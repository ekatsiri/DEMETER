A Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object usually stored as a sequence of Points, with the subtype of Curve specifying the form of the interpolation between Points. This specification defines only one subclass of Curve, LineString, which uses linear interpolation between Points.\r

sf:Geometry rdfs:comment """\r
Geometry is the root class of the hierarchy.\r
The instantiable subclasses of Geometry are restricted to 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometric objects that exist in 2, 3 or 4-dimensional coordinate space (R2, R3 or R4). Geometry values in R2 have points with coordinate values for x and y. Geometry values in R3 have points with coordinate values for x, y and z or for x, y and m. Geometry values in R4 have points with coordinate values for x, y, z and m.\r
The interpretation of the coordinates is subject to the coordinate reference systems associated to the point. All coordinates within a geometry object should be in the same coordinate reference systems. Each coordinate shall be unambiguously associated to a coordinate reference system either directly or through its containing geometry. The z coordinate of a point is typically, but not necessarily, represents altitude or elevation. The m coordinate represents a measurement.\r
All Geometry classes described in this specification are defined so that instances of Geometry are topologically closed, i.e. all represented geometries include their boundary as point sets. This does not affect their representation, and open version of the same classes may be used in other circumstances, such as topological representations.\r

sf:PolyhedralSurface rdfs:comment """\r
A PolyhedralSurface is a contiguous collection of polygons, which share common boundary segments. For each pair of polygons that touch, the common boundary shall be expressible as a finite collection of LineStrings. Each such LineString shall be part of the boundary of at most 2 Polygon patches. \r
For any two polygons that share a common boundary, the top of the polygon shall be consistent. This means that when two LinearRings from these two Polygons traverse the common boundary segment, they do so in opposite directions. Since the Polyhedral surface is contiguous, all polygons will be thus consistently oriented. This means that a non-oriented surface (such as Mbius band) shall not have single surface representations. They may be represented by a MultiSurface.\r
If each such LineString is the boundary of exactly 2 Polygon patches, then the PolyhedralSurface is a simple, closed polyhedron and is topologically isomorphic to the surface of a sphere. By the Jordan Surface Theorem (Jordans Theorem for 2-spheres), such polyhedrons enclose a solid topologically isomorphic to the interior of a sphere; the ball. In this case, the top of the surface will either point inward or outward of the enclosed finite solid. If outward, the surface is the exterior boundary of the enclosed surface. If inward, the surface is the interior of the infinite complement of the enclosed solid. A Ball with some number of voids (holes) inside can thus be presented as one exterior boundary shell, and some number in interior boundary shells.\r

sf:Surface rdfs:comment """\r
A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object.\r
A simple Surface may consists of a single patch that is associated with one exterior boundary and 0 or more interior boundaries. A single such Surface patch in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a simple affine rotation matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0. If the patch is not vertical, the projection onto the same plane is an isomorphism, and can be represented as a linear transformation, i.e. an affine.\r
Polyhedral Surfaces are formed by stitching together such simple Surfaces patches along their common boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the orientation of their planar normals. If all the patches are in alignment (their normals are parallel), then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be represented as a single patch if it is connected.\r
The boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to its exterior and interior boundaries.\r
A Polygon is a simple Surface that is planar. A PolyhedralSurface is a simple surface, consisting of some number of Polygon patches or facets.
