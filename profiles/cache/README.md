# Ontology cache
This is a working directory for ontologies downloaded at run-time but the owl2ldprofile tool. 

It will not be persisted in git

If ontologies are either not accessible by the canonical URI or can be preloaded safely then they should be persisted in the /lib directory and referenced in the profiles manifest at ../lib/profile_cat.ttl
